<p>We encourage everyone to take care of yourself and participate in a way that works for you. If you have the opportunity or time, here are some ideas to get things started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use #Thanks in slack this month to acknowledge another community member's contributions or kindness.</li>
<li>Reach out to a new member or member you haven't seen in a while.</li>
<li>Highlight your office hours or consider holding a group mentoring session.</li>
<li>Share your tips for a skill others struggle with #SkillShare</li>
<li>Give honest and constructive feedback.</li>
</ul>
